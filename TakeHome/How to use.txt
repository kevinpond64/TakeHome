Url is https://localhost:44332/api/covidinfo/LocationName(optional)/StartDate(optional)/EndDate(optional)

The LocationName can be any string matching a State name or County name.

The StartDate and EndDate can be any string that can be parsed as a date but should not contain a forward slash.  The 
string '2020-6-1' will parse at June 1, 2020 for example.  Strings such as "6/1/2020" should not be used. 

The return value consists of a message string and the results.

If no location is specified, the message will say "No location provided."

The api will match with any county matching the LocationName provided or any state matching the LocationName provided.
If there are multiple matches (i.e. Colorado County, Texas and Colorado, the U.S. State), then multiple record sets will 
be returned.

If there are no locations matching the LocationName specified, then the message will say No Results Found.

For states, the data will be combined for every county.

Optional Start Date and End Dates can be provided.  The values should be parsable as a date.  If no value is provided or 
the date cannot be parsed, then the start date will be the first day of data and the end date will be the last day of 
data.  If start date and end dates are provided, the api will only analyze data between those two dates.

There are a few attempts to check the integrity of the data.  One check is that the fields are in the proper position in
the data.  Another is that the dates provided in the data can be parsed as dates and the case counts can be parsed as 
integers.  If any of these checks fail, the message will say errors encountered.

In building this app, the assumption was made that the case counts provided in the data were cumulative case counts and 
would always increase.  For some locations, however, this was found to not be the case.  For those locations and dates,
the daily case count is treated as a negative number.  How to handle such incorrect data can be a topic for further 
discussion.
